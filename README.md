# Projects For Fun

This repository contains some simple Python game experiments.

## Tic Tac Toe (classic)

`Tc-Tc-To.py` implements a console-based Tic Tac Toe game with optional CPU
mode and score keeping.

## Tic Tac Toe Cards

`ttt_cards.py` introduces a new twist combining Tic Tac Toe with a deck of
action cards. Each player draws cards and uses them to place, remove, swap or
block board cells, making each round unpredictable.

Run the card version with:

```bash
python3 ttt_cards.py
```
