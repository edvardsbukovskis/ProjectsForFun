# Projects For Fun

This repository contains some simple Python game experiments.

## Tic Tac Toe (classic)

`Tc-Tc-To.py` implements a console-based Tic Tac Toe game with optional CPU
mode and score keeping.

## Tic Tac Toe Cards

`ttt_cards.py` introduces a new twist combining Tic Tac Toe with a deck of
action cards. Each player draws cards and uses them to place, remove, swap or
block board cells, making each round unpredictable.

Run the card version with:

```bash
python3 ttt_cards.py
```

## Tic Tac Toe Cards GUI

`ttt_cards_gui.py` now offers a more polished experience with a 4x4 board,
animated piece placement and coloured cards. The AI also evaluates the board to
make smarter choices. Use your mouse to select a card and then a board cell.

Run the GUI version with:

```bash
python3 ttt_cards_gui.py
```
